# Getting Started with Go

## Module Initialization

Every Go project starts with a module. Initialize one with:

```bash
go mod init <module-path>
```

This creates a `go.mod` file that describes your module with its name and the Go version used.

## Understanding Packages

In Go, everything is organized into packages. All your code must belong to a package.

Every source file must start with a package declaration. Think of a package as a folder or container that groups related code together.

```go
package main
```

The `package main` is special because it tells the Go compiler:
- This is not just a library
- This is a program that should be turned into an executable file

## The Entry Point

Go needs to know where to start executing code. This is always the `main` function in the `main` package:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

## Importing Packages

Everything comes from a package. Helper functions like `Println` come from the `fmt` package.

- Go programs are organized into packages
- Go's standard library provides different core packages
- `fmt` is one of these, which you can use by importing it
- Check out all packages on the [official documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/std)

## Two Types of Packages

1. **Library Packages**: Collections of code intended to be reused by other programs (like `fmt` or `math`). They don't run on their own.

2. **The Main Package**: The entry point. When you run `go build`, the compiler looks specifically for `package main` to know where the "start button" is.

## Running Your Code

```bash
# Run a single file
go run main.go

# Run all files in the current package
go run .

# Build an executable
go build
```
