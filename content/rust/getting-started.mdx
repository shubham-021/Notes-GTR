# Getting Started with Rust

## Installation

Install Rust using rustup:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Creating a Project

```bash
# Create a new project
cargo new project_name
cd project_name

# Build and run
cargo build           # Compile the project
cargo run             # Build and run
cargo check           # Check for errors without building
cargo build --release # Build with optimizations
```

## Project Structure

```
project_name/
├── Cargo.toml    # Project manifest (dependencies, metadata)
├── Cargo.lock    # Exact dependency versions
└── src/
    └── main.rs   # Entry point
```

## Hello World

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

The `println!` macro prints text to the console. Note the `!` - this indicates it's a macro, not a regular function.
