title: Types vs Interfaces
description: Understanding when to use type aliases vs interfaces
---

Both `type` and `interface` can be used to define object shapes, but they have key differences.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Interface | Type |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Extend other types | Yes (using `extends`) | Yes (using `&`) |
| Implement in classes | Yes | No |
| Declaration merging | Yes | No |
| Union types | No | Yes |
| Intersection types | No (use `extends`) | Yes |
| Primitive aliases | No | Yes |
| Tuple types | No | Yes |

## When to Use Interface

Use `interface` when:

- Defining object shapes
- Creating contracts for classes to implement
- You need declaration merging

```typescript
interface User {
    name: string;
}

// Declaration merging - adds to existing interface
interface User {
    email: string;
}

// User now has both name and email
```

## When to Use Type

Use `type` when:

- Creating union or intersection types
- Creating type aliases for primitives
- Working with tuples
- You need more complex type operations

```typescript
// Union type
type Status = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";

// Primitive alias
type ID = string | number;

// Tuple
type Coordinate = [number, number];

// Intersection
type Employee = User & { department: string };
```

## Extending

```typescript
// Interface extends interface
interface Animal {
    name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
    breed: string;
}

// Type intersection
type Animal = {
    name: string;
};

type Dog = Animal & {
    breed: string;
};
```

## Recommendation

For most cases, prefer `interface` for object types - it's more readable and provides better error messages. Use `type` when you need its unique capabilities like unions or tuples.
