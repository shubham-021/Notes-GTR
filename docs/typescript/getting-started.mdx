description: Setting up TypeScript with npm and configuring your project
---

## Project Setup

```bash
npm init -y
npm install typescript
npx tsc --init
```

This creates a `tsconfig.json` file with TypeScript configuration.

## Configuring tsconfig.json

After initialization, configure key options:

- Set `rootDir` to your source directory (e.g., `"./src"`)
- Set `outDir` to your output directory (e.g., `"./dist"`)

## Compiling TypeScript

```bash
tsc -b          # Build the project
tsc --watch     # Watch mode for development
```

TypeScript compiles `.ts` files to `.js` files that can run anywhere JavaScript runs.
