## Variable Declaration

There are two ways to declare variables in Go:

```go
// Standard declaration
var camelCase = "something"

// Short declaration (walrus operator)
camelCase := "something"
```

## Standard Declaration vs Short Declaration

### `var variableName = "something"`

The formal way to declare a variable:

- **Scope**: Can be used anywhere (inside a function or at the package level outside functions)
- **Type Inference**: Since you assigned a value, Go knows it's a string. You could also be explicit: `var variableName string = "something"`
- **Zero Values**: This is the only way to declare a variable without giving it a value immediately (e.g., `var name string`), which defaults to an empty string `""`

### `name := "something"`

The shorthand (or "Walrus operator") way to declare and initialize:

- **Scope**: Can only be used inside a function. Using this at the top of your file (package level) will cause a compilation error
- **Implicit**: Declares the variable, detects the type, and assigns the value all in one motion
- **Redeclaration**: Often used to quickly grab multiple return values from a function, like `val, err := someFunction()`

### When to Use Which?

Use `:=` whenever possible inside functions. It makes code cleaner, shorter, and easier to read. Most Go developers use this for 90% of their local variables.

Use `var` when:
- You need a package-level variable (outside `func main`)
- You want to declare a variable now but assign it later
- You want to be explicit about the type (e.g., `var price float64 = 10` instead of the default `int`)

## Constants

Use `const` to create variables that cannot be modified:

```go
const name = "Shubham"
name = "Singh" // Error: cannot assign to name

fmt.Println(name)
```

## Printing in Go

```go
var name = "Shubham"
fmt.Println("My name is", name)
```

### Formatted Printing

`Printf` takes a template string with annotation verbs (placeholders):

```go
fmt.Printf("Some text with a variable %s", myVariable)

// Printing types
var name = "Shubham"
var age = 23

fmt.Printf("name is %T, age is %T", name, age) // %T prints the type
```

Common format verbs:
- `%s` - string
- `%d` - integer
- `%f` - float
- `%v` - default format for any value
- `%T` - type of the value
- `%t` - boolean

## Compiler Enforcement

Go enforces better code quality at compile time:
- Variable names must be used (unused variables cause errors)
- Imported packages must be used (unused imports cause errors)
