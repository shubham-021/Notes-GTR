title: Variables and Mutability
description: Immutability by default, mutable variables, constants, and shadowing in Rust
---

By default, variables in Rust are immutable. This is a key safety feature.

## Immutable Variables

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    // x = 6;  // Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

## Mutable Variables

Use `mut` to make a variable mutable:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("x = {}", x);
    x = 6;  // This is allowed
    println!("x = {}", x);
}
```

## Constants

Constants are always immutable and must have a type annotation:

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
const PI: f64 = 3.14159;
```

Note: Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constant names.

## Shadowing

You can declare a new variable with the same name, which shadows the previous one:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;      // Shadows previous x
    let x = x * 2;      // Shadows again
    println!("{}", x);  // Output: 12

    // Shadowing allows type changes
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();  // Now an integer
}
```

Shadowing is different from `mut` because:
- We create a new variable each time
- We can change the type
- The variable remains immutable after each `let`
