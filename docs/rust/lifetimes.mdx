Lifetimes ensure that references are valid for as long as they need to be.

## The Problem

```rust
// This won't compile - dangling reference
fn main() {
    let r;
    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;  // x goes out of scope here
    }
    // println!("{}", r);  // r would be invalid
}
```

## Lifetime Annotations

```rust
// 'a is a lifetime parameter
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let s2 = String::from("xyz");

    let result = longest(&s1, &s2);
    println!("Longest: {}", result);
}
```

The `'a` tells the compiler that the returned reference will live as long as the shortest of the input lifetimes.

## Lifetime Rules (Elision)

The compiler can often infer lifetimes:

1. Each input reference gets its own lifetime
2. If there's one input lifetime, it's assigned to all output references
3. If `&self` is a parameter, its lifetime is assigned to output references

```rust
// These are equivalent:
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str { /* ... */ }
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str { /* ... */ }
```

## Lifetimes in Structs

When a struct holds references, it needs lifetime annotations:

```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,  // Must live as long as the struct
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().unwrap();

    let excerpt = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    };
}
```

## Static Lifetime

References with the `'static` lifetime live for the entire program duration:

```rust
// Lives for the entire program duration
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
```

String literals have a `'static` lifetime because they're stored in the binary.

## Key Points

- Lifetimes are about ensuring references don't outlive their data
- The borrow checker uses lifetimes to prevent dangling references
- Most of the time, lifetimes are inferred automatically
- When the compiler can't infer, you must annotate explicitly
